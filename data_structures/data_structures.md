#	Notes About Data Structures and Algorithms

See my *LaTeX* report about [data structures and algorithms](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/boilerplate-code/tree/master/notes/report), including a typeset [PDF copy of the report](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/boilerplate-code/blob/master/notes/report/data-structures_n_algor.pdf).

##	To-Do List

+ [ ] Implement a generic graph.
	- [ ] Implement *vertex class.
	- [ ] Test *vertex class.
	- [x] Implement *edge* class.
		* Ignored, because it is hard to find similarities between edges of directed and undirected graphs.
	- [x] Test *edge* class.
	- [ ] Implement *graph* class.
	- [ ] Test *graph* class.
+ [ ] Implement an undirected graph, which extends a generic graph.
	- [ ] Implement vertex_ug class.
	- [ ] Test vertex_ug class.
	- [ ] Implement edge_ug class.
	- [ ] Test edge_ug class.
	- [ ] Implement graph_ug class.
	- [ ] Test graph_ug class.
+ [ ] Implement a directed graph, which extends a generic graph.
	- [ ] Implement vertex_dg class.
	- [ ] Test vertex_dg class.
	- [ ] Implement edge_dg class.
	- [ ] Test edge_dg class.

For each class, implement the following:
	- Constructor:
		* Default constructor.
		* Standard constructor(s) (if any).
	- Attributes/Properties/Fields.
	- Accessor methods for its attributes.
	- Mutator methods for its attributes.
	- Other methods.
	- Test each constructor.
	- Test each method.

##	Notes (and Assumptions)

###	Graph Implementations With Other Data Structures

As noted in \cite[\S2.3.3, pp. 13, points 1(a) and 1(e) about required data structures supporting the implementation of graphs]{Ong2017}, faster implementations of graph common algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's single-source shortest path algorithm and Primâ€™s/Prim-Jarnik algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree) use a priority queue (specifically a Fibonacci heap implementation) to perform certain steps faster.

In *Python*, I can use the *heapq* module to use a heap without implementing my own Fibonacci heap.

Also, I can use sets to store collections of vertices and edges of a graph, rather than a list, so that I do not have to implement a set-like data structure myself. The default set data structure in *Python* is a fast implementation \cite{PythonWikiContributors2017}.

***Determine if there exists default implementations of circular arrays and queues (FIFOs).***

*Python*'s default implementations of:
+ queues (FIFOs):
	- [Use a deque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-ended_queue), since "a double-ended queue (abbreviated to deque) is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue".
		* Wikipedia contributors, ``Double-ended queue,'' in *Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia: Abstract data types*, Wikimedia Foundation, San Francisco, CA, May 15, 2019. Available online at: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-ended_queue}; last accessed on May 16, 2019.
	- Use [synchronized queues](https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html).
+ circular arrays
	- [use collections.deque with a maxlen arg](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4151320/efficient-circular-buffer)
	- [NumPy's ringbuffer](https://pypi.org/project/numpy_ringbuffer/)


Similarly, determine how to implement open addressing in *Python* \cite[\S2.3.3, pp. 14, points 2 and 3 about required data structures supporting the implementation of graphs]{Ong2017}.


###	Miscellaneous Comments

####	*generic graph* class

For the *generic graph* class, use sets instead of lists to store its vertices and edges, so that I don't have to implement the set-like features to manipulate these vertices and edges.
+ *set_of_vertices*
+ *set_of_edges*

####	*undirected graph* classes

+ **graph_ug** class:
	- When implementing the **graph_ug** class, ignore the following for now.
		* *set_of_connected_components*
		* *set_of_cycles*
+ **vertex_ug** class:
	- variables:
		* dict *adjacent_vertices*
			+ Use a dictionary to implement the adjacency map representation of graphs.
+ **edge_ug** class:
	- variables:
		* *set_of_endpoints*



####	*directed graph* class

+ **graph_dg** class:
	- When implementing the **graph_dg** class, ignore the following for now.
		* *set_of_strongly_connected_components*
		* *set_of_directed_cycles*
+ **vertex_dg** class:
	- variables:
		* dict *source_vertices*
			+ Use a dictionary to implement the adjacency map representation of graphs.
		* dict *dstn_vertices*
			+ Use a dictionary to implement the adjacency map representation of graphs.
+ **edge_dg** class:
	- variables:
		* *set_of_source_vertices*
		* *set_of_dstn_vertices*
